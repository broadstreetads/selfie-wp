Selfie: Native in-post text ads that your readers can purchase themselves.

== Description ==

**Public Beta**

Your loyal readers are an untapped source of revenue. You will never know how
many potential advertisers are reading your site; until you try Selfie.

Selfie is a hands off solution for letting your readers and businesses post
messages and promotions within your article. It's hands-free for you,
an awesome non-sleezy advertising option for the business.

Just insert a simple shortcode, **[selfie]**, in a post where you want a 
self-serve text ad slot to appear.
