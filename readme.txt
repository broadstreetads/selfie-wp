Selfie: Native in-post text ads that your readers can purchase themselves.

== Description ==

Sometimes you write content that is **really** appealing to a specific
market or business. Maybe you wrote an article on blenders which is near the
top of Google results, and a blender wholesaler would love to purchase a text ad 
within that article.

Selfie is a hands off solution for letting your reders and businesses post
messages and promotions within your article. It's hands-free for you,
an awesome non-sleezy advertising option for the business.

Just insert a simple shortcode, **[[selfie]]**, in a post where you want a 
self-serve text ad slot to appear.

Watch the demo:

Broadstreet is a team of veteran ad-tech folks with a long track record of

**How to:**

1. Install the plugin
2. Go to Settings->Selfie
3. Enter your Access Token and confirm that it's valid (we'll check automatically)
